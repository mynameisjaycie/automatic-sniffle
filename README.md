DecryptCode – Senior Full-Stack Engineer Assessment

This repository contains my submission for the DecryptCode Senior Full-Stack Engineer take-home assessment.

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how I approach building user-facing features, structuring backend logic, and making practical engineering decisions under time constraints.

Overview

This project is a simple e-commerce application built with:
	•	Frontend: React
	•	Backend: Node.js
	•	Data: In-memory mock data (products, categories, orders)

The application allows users to:
	•	Browse products
	•	View product details
	•	View and manage a shopping cart

⸻

Scope of Work

The assessment includes:
	•	5 required tasks
	•	3 frontend-focused tasks
	•	2 backend-focused tasks
	•	2 optional nice-to-have tasks

My focus was on correctness, clarity, and maintainability rather than over-engineering.

⸻

Approach

Given the 40–60 minute timebox, I prioritized:
	•	Clear separation of frontend and backend concerns
	•	Readable, maintainable code
	•	Thoughtful component structure on the frontend
	•	Simple, predictable API behavior on the backend
	•	Practical tradeoffs appropriate for the scope

Where relevant, I favored clarity over abstraction and documented decisions directly in the code when helpful.

Running the Project

Instructions for running the frontend and backend locally can be found in their respective folders.

Notes

This solution is intentionally lightweight and focused on the requested functionality. With additional time, I would further expand error handling, test coverage, and state management patterns as appropriate for a production system.

Thank you for the opportunity—I enjoyed working through this exercise.
